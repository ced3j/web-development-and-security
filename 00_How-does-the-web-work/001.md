# How Does the Web Work?

User Request: When you type a website address (like www.google.com) into your browser, your browser sends a request for that website.
DNS Lookup: The browser contacts a DNS (Domain Name System) server to find the IP address of the website.
Data Transfer: Once the IP address is found, the browser communicates with the web server hosting the website.
Response: The web server sends the requested web page or data back to the browser.
Rendering: The browser processes the data and displays the website on your screen.
