# How Does the Web Work?

1. **User Request** 
    When you type a website address (like www.google.com) into your browser, your browser sends a request for that website.

2. **DNS Lookup** 
    The browser contacts a DNS (Domain Name System) server to find the IP address of the website.

3. **Data Transfer** 
    Once the IP address is found, the browser communicates with the web server hosting the website.

4. **Response** 
    The web server sends the requested web page or data back to the browser.

5. **Rendering**
    The browser processes the data and displays the website on your screen.
