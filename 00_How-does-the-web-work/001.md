# How Does the Internet Work?

The Internet is the backbone of the Web, the technical infrastructure that makes the Web possible. At its most basic, the Internet is a large network of computers which communicate all together.
This document explains what happens step by step when you type `google.com` into your browser and press Enter.

---

### 1. **You Type the URL**
   - You open your browser and type `google.com` in the address bar. This is called a **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**.
   - Your browser doesn’t understand `google.com` directly. It needs to find the IP address of the server hosting Google’s website.

---

### 2. **DNS Resolution**
   - The browser sends a request to a **DNS (Domain Name System)** server to convert `google.com` into an IP address, like `142.250.190.14`.
   - If the browser has cached this IP from a previous visit, it skips this step.

---

### 3. **Browser Sends an HTTP/HTTPS Request**
   - After obtaining the IP address, the browser sends an HTTP (or HTTPS for secure communication) request to Google’s server.
   - The request contains details like:
     - The type of request (GET, POST, etc.).
     - The requested resource (e.g., the homepage).
     - Your browser and operating system details.

---

### 4. **Router Sends Data Packets**
   - Your computer breaks the request into **packets** (small pieces of data).
   - These packets are sent to your router, which directs them toward Google’s server using the best path through the internet.

---

### 5. **Travel Through the Internet**
   - The packets travel through several routers and networks, including your ISP (Internet Service Provider) and backbone networks.
   - Each router reads the destination IP in the packet header and forwards it closer to Google’s server.

---

### 6. **Google’s Server Receives the Request**
   - When the packets reach Google’s server, they are reassembled to reconstruct your original request.
   - Google’s server processes the request and prepares a response (e.g., the homepage of Google).

---

### 7. **Response Packets Travel Back**
   - Google’s server splits the response (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) into packets and sends them back to your computer.
   - These packets travel through the internet, often taking different paths to optimize speed.

---

### 8. **Browser Reassembles the Response**
   - When your browser receives the response packets, it reassembles them in the correct order.
   - The browser interprets the data (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and displays Google’s homepage on your screen.

---

### 9. **Additional Requests**
   - If the page requires additional resources (like images or scripts), the browser sends more requests to Google’s server or other servers hosting those resources.
